#[User Story 1]
If I open the page and there is no bridge tree stored in the local storage,
then a default tree is saved in the local storage. The default tree contains 
the we_root + the biddings 1c ... 1NT, plus the 1nt children 2c ... 2h, and the them_root.
The bid 1NT has a description: 15-17 punten, sans-atout verdeling.

#[User Story 2]
If I open the page, then the bridge tree is loaded from the local storage 
(TODO: exception thrown if not exists or if ls is not defined),
and shown to the user. The view consists of: 
(ordered) tree structure with open/close, bid + description, we and them nodes have different colors.
*the root node is open, the other nodes are closed.

#[User Story 3]
I can edit the description of existing bid conventions.
The changes are propagated to the viewmodel with each keystroke,
the changed description is made persistent (in local storage) after the
description input element looses focus.
The description input element looses focus when user presses the enter key.

#[User Story 4]
I can select a bidding node with a mouse click,
the bidding node gets a new color, the same holds for all its descendant nodes.
//TODO: I can deselect by clicking somewhere else.

# [User Story 5]
I can open a context-menu for a bid convention using the right mouse button.
The context menu contains the following items:
Select (Ctrl + T), New (Ctrl + N), Delete (Delete).
The functionality is not yet implemented.
* The bidconvention gets selected in case 0 or 1 bids selected

# [User Story 6]
I can delete a selected bid with the Context Menu item, or by using
the delete button. In both cases a dialog appears asking wether 
I am sure to delete the bid ... and all its subsequent biddings.
* Delete is disabled for the root.

[User Story 7]
I can replace an existing bid using a bidpicker.
#- bidpicker becomes visible at the mouse location when bid is clicked
#- bidbutton click replaces the old bid in model, model is saved to ls, bidpicker disappears, replaced bid still selected
# bidpicker shows the current bid as preselected, valid replacement is checked, succeeding bids are checked
# bidpicker 'blur' makes the bidpicker invisible 
# css style gives a reasonable picker view

[User Story 8]
I can add a new bid (child of selected) via the context menu, or via the shortcut Ctrl + N.
A bid-picker appears, only the valid bids are enabled, the pass bid is pre-selected(?).
In the bidpicker I can select the bid using a mouse click,
//TODO: or by using the arrows followed by the enter button. 
After selecting a bid, the new child bid is added to the tree (viewmodel + local storage).
Furthermore, the parent of the new child bid is open,
and the new child bid is selected.
* In case no bid is valid (not even pass), the menu item 'New' is disabled.

[User Story 9]
I can select a bid using the context menu item 'Select' or using the shortcut
Ctrl + T. The selected bid is set as the 'root' bid sequence.
The root bidsequence view consist of a large bar (root) + 
bid buttons ordered in squences of 4.
I can select the root bid to set the root as the root bidsequence.

[User Story 10]
I can select bids from the root bid sequence.
