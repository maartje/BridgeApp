[User Story 1]
If I open the page and there is no bridge tree stored in the local storage,
then a default tree is saved in the local storage. The default tree contains 
the we_root + the biddings 1c ... 1NT, plus the 1nt children 2c ... 2h, and the them_root.
The bid 1NT has a description: 15-17 punten, sans-atout verdeling.

[User Story 2]
If I open the page, then the bridge tree is loaded from the local storage (exception thrown if known exists or if ls not defined),
and shown to the user. The view consists of 1. ordered tree structure with open/close, bid + description, we and them nodes have different colors.
*the root node is open, the other nodes are closed.

[User Story 3]
I can edit the description of existing bid conventions.
The changes are propagated to the viewmodel with each keystroke,
the changed description is made persistent (in local storage) after the
description input element looses focus.

I can delete a selected bid with the Context Menu item, or by using
the delete button. In both cases a dialog appears asking wether 
I am sure to delete the bid ... and all its subsequent biddings.
* Delete is disabled for the root.

After selecting a bid, the new child bid is added to the tree (viewmodel + local storage).
